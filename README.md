<h1>Business 310 (Data Science/Decision Science) Project</h1>
<h2>By Keanu Valencia</h2>

<p>This Repository will be used to document my work for my third BUS 310 Project.</p>

<p>Start Date: 10/2/24</p>

<P>Due Date: 10/27/24</P>

<p>For this project, I will be conducting a hypothesis test of the Mean Sold Price of every property in Maui that appeared on the Hotsheet from September 2023 to September 2024.<p>

<p>If you ask someone in Maui what they think the average (Mean) price is a home, they will most likley say 1 million!</p>
<p>Therefore, our Null Hypothesis will H0 = 1,000,000. Our Alternative Hypothesis would be Ha != 1,000,000.</p>
