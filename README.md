<h1>Business 310 (Data Science/Decision Science) Project</h1>
<h2>By Keanu Valencia</h2>

<p>This Repository will be used to document my work for my third BUS 310 Project.</p>

<p>Start Date: 10/2/24</p>

<P>Due Date: 10/27/24</P>

<p>For this project, I will be conducting a hypothesis test of the Mean Sold Price of homes in Maui.<p>

<p>If you ask someone in Maui to guess the average (Mean) price of a home, they will most likely say 1 to 2 million. Therefore, lets validate this claim by using hypothesis testing on a sample of sold Maui properties that appeared on the Hotsheet from September 2023 to September 2024.</p>
<p>Our Null Hypothesis will be H0 = 1,500,000, while our Alternative Hypothesis will be Ha != 1,500,000. I will use a significance level of a = 0.05 (industry standard).</p>
